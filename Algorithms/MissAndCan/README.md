# Missionaries and cannibals problem and Uniform Cost Search.

## Intro

When I see interesting approach for store state (and recalculate) and previous way information in [article about this problem](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/16234/AI-Search-to-Solve-the-Missionaries-and-Cannibals), I want to 
rewrite this with current C# language standart with my favorite algorithm (because it is similar to A*, but without ideal implementation because standart collection:) ) and with 
programm architecture as I want and understand.

And yes, my State class not equal, but similar to State class from article, other sources written by me from zero to all.

## Skills
-  Uniform Cost Search
-  DataGrid for output
-  Unit testing
